## Fictitious Data Notice

**ALL DATA GENERATED BY THE SCRIPTS IN THIS DIRECTORY IS ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS.**

### Purpose

This project generates synthetic data for:
- Demonstration purposes
- Educational training
- Software testing
- Technical presentations

### What is Fictitious

All of the following are computer-generated and do not represent real entities:

#### 1. **Supplier Names**
- All company names (e.g., "Acme Lights & Co.", "BrightBeam Systems Demo", etc.)
- Contact phone numbers
- Business addresses and locations
- Service details

#### 2. **Geographic Data**
- While using real Bengaluru (Bangalore) coordinate bounds
- All specific light locations are randomly generated
- Neighborhood boundaries are simplified and fictitious
- No actual street addresses are used

#### 3. **Operational Data**
- Maintenance records are simulated
- Failure predictions are mock data (not real ML predictions)
- Weather patterns are simplified approximations
- All timestamps and dates are generated for testing

#### 4. **Personal Information**
- Contact phone numbers use placeholder format
- No real personal data is used or collected
- All identifiers (IDs, names) are system-generated

### Legal Protection

This project is protected by the following safeguards:

1. **Clear Labeling**: Many supplier names include "Demo" suffix to indicate fictitious nature
2. **Generic Terms**: Names use common industry terms without trademarked names
3. **Educational Use**: Project is clearly marked as educational/demo
4. **No Real Data**: No actual business data or real coordinates of infrastructure
5. **Open Source**: Transparent generation scripts show algorithmic creation

### Trademark Compliance

We have specifically avoided:
- ❌ Real company trademarks
- ❌ Brand names of actual lighting suppliers
- ❌ Registered business names
- ❌ Copyrighted company identifiers

We have used:
- ✅ Generic descriptive terms (e.g., "Bright", "Light", "Glow")
- ✅ Clearly fictitious names (e.g., "Acme", "QuantumLight")
- ✅ Demo/Test suffixes (e.g., "Demo Corp", "Demo Inc")
- ✅ Creative combinations that don't match real entities

### Regeneration

You can regenerate all data at any time using:

```bash
cd data
./generate_all_data.sh
```

This will create new random data with different:
- Locations
- Timestamps
- Phone numbers
- Identifiers

### Contact

If you believe any generated name inadvertently resembles a real trademark or business entity, please contact the project maintainers. We will promptly regenerate the data with alternative names.

### License

This data generation code and the generated data are provided under the project's license for educational and demonstration purposes only.
